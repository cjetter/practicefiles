'''Ch9 . Ex 1: Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. 
It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

NOTE: Code is still messy. Would need to add in try/except, data input entry boxes, and determine if there is a way to simplify the 
parsing process and passage of data between text, string, list and dictionary. Also, need to identify how to capture vocab with multiple nouns
