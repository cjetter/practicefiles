    "#Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack Game\n",
    "In this milestone project you will be creating a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game\n",
    "* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.\n",
    "* The player can stand or hit.\n",
    "* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.\n",
    "* You need to keep track of the players total money.\n",
    "* You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "And most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to expand this game-try including multiple players. Try adding in Double-Down and card splits! Remember to you are free to use any resources you want and as always:\n",

    "    3)  All players begin with a bankroll of $100. No additional amounts may be contributed. Minimum $10 bet\n",
    "        per round.\n",
    "    4)  When the dealer's face-down card is turned up, If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. \n",
    "        If the total is 16 or under, it must take a card and must continue taking cards until the \n",

    "        it as 11 would bring its total to 17 or more (but not over 21), it must count the ace as 11 \n",
    "        and stand. Thus, the dealer's decisions are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always \n",
    "        has the option of taking one or more cards.\n",
    "    5)  If the player goes bust, she has already lost her wager, even if the dealer goes bust as well.\n",
    "    6)  If the dealer goes over 21, it pays each player who has stood the amount of that player's bet. \n",
    "    7)  If the dealer stands at 21 or less, it pays the bet of any player having a higher total \n",
    "        (not exceeding 21) and collects the bet of any player having a lower total. \n",
